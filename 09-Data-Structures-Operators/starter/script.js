// We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!
// Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game (below). In this challenge we're gonna work with the data. So here are your tasks:

// 1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2')
const [players1, players2] = game.players;
console.log(players1, players2);
// 2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players
const [gk, ...fieldPlayers] = players1;
console.log(gk, fieldPlayers);
// 3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)
const allPlayers = [...players1, ...players2];
console.log(allPlayers);
// 4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
const substitutePlayers = ['Thiago', 'Coutinho', 'Perisic'];
const players1Final = [...players1, ...substitutePlayers];
console.log(players1Final);
// 5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
//const { team1, x: draw, team2 } = game.odds;
// 5. another solution:
const {
  odds: { team1, x: draw, team2 },
} = game;
console.log(team1, draw, team2);
// 6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player names (NOT an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
const printGoals = function (...players) {
  for (let i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let j = 0; j < game.scored.length; j++) {
      if (players[i] === game.scored[j]) count++;
    }
    console.log(players[i], count);
  }
};
printGoals('Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski', 'Kimmich');
printGoals(...game.scored);
// 7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which team is more likely to win, WITHOUT using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.
team1 < team2 && console.log('Team 1 is more likely to win');
team1 > team2 && console.log('Team 2 is more likely to win');
// TEST DATA FOR 6: Use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from game.scored

BONUS: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this game, it will look like this:
